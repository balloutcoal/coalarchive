# Review
* SI Units
* Ampere (Amps) symbol A, circuit variable i
* Ampere is a flow of charge
	* where q is a flow of charge (coulombs/sec) $$i = dq/dt$$
* A volt is a measure of electrical potential (energy) symbol V, circuit variable v
	* Voltage is also called the electro-motive force (forces charge to move)
* Power (watts)$$p = v * i$$and energy (joules)$$w=\int_{p0}^{p1}pdt $$
# New
* The passive sign convention
* The concept of ground
## Passive Sign Convention
* Current is called a through variable (current (or the charge flow) goes through a circuit element)
* Voltage is called an across variable (voltage is established across a circuit element)
## Ground
 ![[ground schem.png|100x100]]
* When one terminal of many devices is common
* Ground is the reference for voltage (potential energy)
	* Ground is 0V as the reference
## Voltage Supplies
![[voltage sources.png|275x200]]
### Independent Sources
Often described as a circle with a + on one wire, and a - on another wire with V0 next to it, typically for DC power
* Batteries
* 'Power' supplies
* Line Power
### Dependent Sources
Described as a diamond with a + and - on each side connecting to a wire
* Voltage source: $V = \beta V_1 = \alpha i_1$
* Current source: $i = \beta i_1= \alpha V_1$
## Resistors
![[Pasted image 20250115111507.png|100x100]]
* Symbol R, Ohm's law continued: $I = \frac{V}{R}$ OR where $\frac{1}{R}$ is the slope and V is X (basic algebra) $I = \frac{1}{R}V$
## Power
* Power formulas:
	* $p = Vi$
	* $p=\frac{V^2}{R}$
	* $p=i^2R$
## Instruments
* Thermistor
	* Higher temperature means more resistance, lower temperature means less resistance
	* Used for digitally tracking temperatures
