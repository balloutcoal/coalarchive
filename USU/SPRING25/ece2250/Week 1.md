# Intro
We study circuits to learn how to design circuits
## Circuits
* Circuits fulfill functions
* Function is achieved by manipulating <u>circuit variables</u> using <u>circuit elements</u>
	* Circuit variables: voltage, current, power
	* Circuit elements: voltage sources, current sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors
### Functions
* Circuit elements are used to build function
* Circuit <u>elements</u> and circuit <u>variables</u> follows simple rules
* Complex function is achieved through linking simple sub-functions
	* "We design circuits sequentially <u>not</u> simultaneously" -Middlebrook
### Elements and Variables
* Circuit elements and variables follow three simple rules
	* Ohm's Law: V = IR (V = voltage, I = current, R = resistance)
	* Kircchoff's Current Law: Current doesn't bunch at a circuit intersection
		* Analogy where cars at an intersection never cause traffic
	* Kircchoff's Voltage Law: Voltages around any loop in a circuit have to sum to zero
		* Analogy where a car in an elevator and a ramp going back down, the car will never end up higher or lower than the elevator
* These three laws are all we need to analyze/build any circuit. They work every time
### Sources
* Voltage sources
* Current sources
* Resistor -> learn about resistors, translate into capacitors and inductors
### Definitions/Conventions
* power = voltage * currnet
* Circuit with the same end/start point is closed loop, and otherwise is open loop which is almost always not intended to be that way
* Electric Current -> flowing charge -> units of coulombs
	* flowing is change in time -> i = dq/dt
* Charge of an electron -1.6x10^-19 C
* Voltage V = dw/dq (dw = change in energy (joules), dq = amount of charge (coulombs))
	* Volts = Joules/coulombs
* Power -> the flow of energy
	* p = dw/dt = (dw/dq)(dq/dt) = vi (joules/sec) = watt
### Fundamental Units of the SI System
* m - meters (length)
* kg - kilogram (mass)
* s - seconds (time)
* A - amperage (current)
* K - kelvin (temperature)
* cd - candela (light intensity)
* C/q - coulombs (charge)
