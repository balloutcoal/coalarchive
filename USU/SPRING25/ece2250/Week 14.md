## Thennanin's Equivalent
4/14/25 circuit 1
* $V_T=V_{in}$
* $R_T=i_{sc}$ find this one
* $V_T=\frac{V_{in}R_2||R_3}{R_1+R_2||R_3}$
	* Ignore $R_4$ since we were finding open circuit
* $V_1=\frac{VinR_2||R_3||R_4}{R_1+R_2||R_3||R_4}{R_1+R_2||R_3||R_4}$
	* $R_4$ is included since we were using closed circuit
* $i_{sc}=\frac{V_1}{R_4}$
* $R_T=\frac{V_{oc}}{i_{sc}}$
# Capacitors
* Magic Equation:
	* $V_C=(V_I-V_F)e^{-t/\tau}+V_F$
		* Only 1 Resistor and Capacitor
