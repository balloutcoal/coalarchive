# Dependent Sources
## Examples

### Example 2:
* $\mu{V_X}$ is dependent on $V_2$
* $R_4$ Does not matter here
## Gain Ratio/Transfer Function
* $\frac{V_B}{V_S}=\frac{-\mu G_1}{G_1+G_2+(1+\mu)G_3}=\frac{-G_1}{G_3}=\frac{-R_1}{R_3}$
	* Derived from $V_B$ from example 2
	* $G_1+G_2 << (1+\mu)G_3$ so the other Gs are negligible
	* The 1 is negligible too so you could revoke all this stuff and still be very accurate
