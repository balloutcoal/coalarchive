# Maximum Signal Transfer
## Three Cases
1. What load resistance gives us maximum voltage across the load?
2. What load resistance gives us maximum current through the load
3. What load resistance gives us maximum power dissipated by the load?
## Questions for Examples
### One
1. What is the maximum voltage available across a load resistor? $V_{TH}$
2. What does $R_l$ have to be in order for $V_l=V_{TH}$? $R_l$ is infinite
3. What is the power transferred to the infinite load resistance? $\frac{V^2}{R}, i^2 R$
### Two
INSERT CURRENT DIAGRAM
4. What is the maximum available current through the load $R_l$? $i_N$
5. What $R_l$ is required for $i_R=i_N$? $R_l=0$
6. What is the power transferred to the load in the max current case? $i^2 R$ R is zero $p=0$

### The maximum
* $i_{R_l}=\frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH}+R_l}$
* $V_{R_l}=\frac{V_{TH}R_l}{R_{TH}+R_l}$
* $P_{R_l}=i_{R_l}V_{R_l}=\frac{V_{TH}^2R_l}{(R_{TH}R_l)^2}$
* $\frac{dP_{R_l}}{dR_l}=?$
* $\frac{d}{dR_l}(\frac{u}{v})=$ use quotient rule on u/v but plug in $P_{R_l}$
* $P_{max}=\frac{V_{TH}^2R_{TH}}{(2R_{TH})^2}=\frac{V_{TH}^2}{4R_{TH}}$
