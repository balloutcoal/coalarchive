# Sorting
## Bubble
start at list -> compare first and second value -> if second is less than first swap -> move second value to the next value in the list -> repeat until sorted
## Insertion
start at first "unsorted" part of list -> shift the unsorted value until it's value is less than what's ahead of it -> repeat until sorted
## Quick
find a pivot in the list (usually middle) -> move values where those less than the pivot point are on the left, and greater are on the right -> repeat until sorted
# Binary Tree
## Addition and Search
### Addition
Way to insert a value into a binary tree
Start at root -> traverse left or right depending on value to find empty node (null) -> place insert point
### Search
A binary tree is formatted as a 2 sided linked list, the left child of a node is smaller than the parent, and the right is greater, allowing ease of finding a value
# Virtual Function and Polymorphism
## Virtual Function
A member in a base class can be overridden by a derived class
## Polymorphism
Function overloading, basically where functions of the same name can be called separately by the values used to call them (void function(int x), void function(char z))
# STL: Vector Operations
Dynamic array that resizes itself automatically part of the STL library (like std)
Also uses templates
# Miscellaneous Topics
## Recursion, Stacks, Queue, Array, Pointer
simple enough don't need notes
## Class declaration (constructor/destructors)
simple enough aswell creating/destroying class objects
## OOP concepts (inheritance/polymorphism)
see above
## Guessing Output From Code Snippets
simple enough just know the c++ syntax
